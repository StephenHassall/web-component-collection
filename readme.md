## Web Component Collection

This is a collection of Web Components I have created and used over the years. Some of them are used and blogger about on my [CodeRunDebug.com](https://coderundebug.com) web site. 

Use the `server.js` project to run the repo as a server and view the examples in your browser (using `Visual Studio Code` and `NodeJS`). Start it and point your browser to `localhost:3000`. There is little extra styling so it will look very basic.

Everything here is free and under the licensed under the [Creative Commons Zero License](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), which means you can use, alter, share, or even sell any of the code you find on this site without attribution to CodeRunDebug.com.

I encourage you to share the content with your community, but please, wholesale stealing is wrong, do not claim it as your own.
